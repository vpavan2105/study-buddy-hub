# study-buddy-hub

## Description:
 Develop a platform where students can create virtual study groups, collaborate on projects, share resources, and communicate with each other in real-time.

## Key Features:

User Authentication: Implement user authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to allow users to sign up, log in, and manage their profiles securely.

Study Group Creation: Allow users to create study groups for specific subjects, courses, or projects. They should be able to set the group's name, description, privacy settings, and invite other users to join.

Group Chat: Integrate real-time chat functionality using Socket.IO or a similar technology to enable group members to communicate with each other via text messages. Users should be able to create multiple chat rooms within a study group for different topics or discussions.

File Sharing: Implement a file-sharing feature that allows users to upload and share documents, presentations, and other study materials within their study groups. You can use cloud storage solutions like AWS S3 for storing files securely.

Event Scheduling: Enable users to schedule study sessions, group meetings, or events using a calendar feature. Users should be able to set the date, time, location (virtual or physical), and agenda for each event. Integration with third-party calendar APIs like Google Calendar can enhance this feature.

Resource Sharing: Provide a platform for users to share useful resources such as links to online articles, videos, textbooks, or study guides. Users should be able to categorize resources by subject, topic, or type for easy navigation and access.

Notifications: Implement a notification system to alert users about new messages, group invitations, upcoming events, and other relevant activities within their study groups. You can use push notifications for instant updates on web and mobile devices.

Responsive Design: Ensure that the web application is responsive and mobile-friendly, allowing users to access and interact with the platform seamlessly across various devices and screen sizes.
